# Live Weather App

Developed a live weather application during a hackathon using a specified API that relies on browser geolocation.

The app provides real-time weather updates and adjusts its user interface based on weather conditions. This was implemented using React.js.

I've made this in just 1 hour for HackNeog Hackathon.

## Features

- Gives live weather update
- Takes geolocation coordinates from browser
- Live weather api is used
- Dynamic UI based on weather condition
- Accessable from any browser with compatibilty
