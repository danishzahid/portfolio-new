# Full-stack To-do App

The application showcases my proficiency in full-stack development and utilization of contemporary technologies.
The frontend is built with ReactJS, while the backend leverages Express and MongoDB Cloud for database storage.
The deployment involves using Vercel for the frontend and Render for the backend.
